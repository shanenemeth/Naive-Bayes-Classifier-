# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-
* Analyzed a college admissions dataset to predict the probabiltiy of whether a student was admitted to a school based off 3 independent variables - "GPA", "GRE", and school "RANK" and 1 response variable - "ADMIT"
* Utilzied a Naive Bayes classification algorithm to predict probability of admisison
* Converted "RANK" and  "ADMIT" variables to factors 
* Partinioned the data into testing and trainign subsets
* Plotted the model to obtain density plots of "GRE" and "GPA" variables
* Accuracy of the model was .72, sensitivity was .90 and specificity was .32 
* [Packages used: "naivebayes", "dplyr", "caret" and "e1071"]
