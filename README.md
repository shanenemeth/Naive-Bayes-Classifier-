# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-
* Analyzed a college admissions dataset to predict the probabiltiy of whether a student was admitted to a school based off 3 independent variables - "GPA", "GRE", "RANK" and 1 response variable - "ADMIT"
* Utilized a Naive Bayes classification algorithm to predict probability of admisison
* Converted "RANK" and  "ADMIT" variables to factors 
* Partitioned the data into testing and training subsets
* Plotted the model to obtain density plots of "GRE" and "GPA" variables
* Accuracy of the model was .72, sensitivity was .90 and specificity was .32 
* [Packages used: "naivebayes", "dplyr", "caret", "ggplot2" and "e1071"]
